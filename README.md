# Eye-Quality (EyeQ) Assessment Dataset 

The project web for "Evaluation of Retinal Image Quality Assessment Networks in Different Color-spaces" in MICCAI 2019.

## -Introduction:

Eye-Quality (EyeQ) Assessment Dataset is a re-annotatation subset from the [EyePACS dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection) for fundus image quality assessment. 

EyeQ dataset has 28,792 retinal images with a three-level quality grading (i.e., 'Good', 'Usable' and 'Reject').

## -Usage:

1. The original fundus images could be downloaded from  [EyePACS dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection). 
2. All the original fundus images should be pre-porcessed by *'EyeQ\_process\_main.py'* in folder './EyeQ_preprocess'.
3. The quality label is in './data' folder, where the *'Label\_EyeQ\_train.csv'* and *'Label\_EyeQ\_test.csv'* are divided by EyePACS, and the 'DR\_grade' label is also from EyePACS.
4. We also release our Multiple Color-space Fusion Network (MCF-Net) based on ResNet121 in './MCFNet' folder. 

**Note:** The trained model  of MCF-Net *'DenseNet121\_v3\_v1.tar'* (~112MB) could be download from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArBRrL8ao6jznU6RCbo60oStjPWZ?e=3g1VOG).
